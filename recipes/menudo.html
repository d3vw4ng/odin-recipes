        <li>½ pound pork liver</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add pork chops and return to a boil. Cook pork chops at a boil for 5 minutes, remove, and set aside to cool. Remove 1 cup of broth from the pot and set aside for later use. Once chops are cooled to the touch, cut them into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Return water to a boil; add pork liver to the pot and cook at a boil until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard liquid. Set liver aside to cool; cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir pork chops into onion and garlic; cook and stir together for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add tomatoes and reserved broth; cover and cook for 10 minutes. Stir pork liver, garbanzo beans, raisins, and potatoes into the mixture; cover and simmer until potatoes are fork tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
